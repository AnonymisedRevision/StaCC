"""Pool members.

Architecture is one of the axes the pool randomises over.  A committee whose
members share a backbone can still disagree, but disagreement bought from
initialisation and augmentation alone tends to be shallow; different families
fail on different images, which is what puts distance between prediction
signatures.
