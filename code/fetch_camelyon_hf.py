"""Fetch the Camelyon17 mirror and check it against the official WILDS counts.

The CodaLab host serving the official WILDS archives has been down.  The
HuggingFace mirror ``wltjr1007/Camelyon17-WILDS`` is a complete copy of the
dataset -- all 455,954 patches -- repackaged as parquet under three split names
rather than four.  Only the packaging differs, and row arithmetic pins it down:

    mirror train       302,436  = WILDS train                   (identical)
    mirror validation   68,464  = WILDS id_val (33,560) + val (34,904)
    mirror test         85,054  = WILDS test                    (identical)

Every row carries its ``center``, so the official four-way protocol is recovered
exactly by filtering on hospital, which ``pack_camelyon.py`` does and refuses to
proceed unless all four counts match.  No hospital is missing and no split is
approximated; the experiments run on the official protocol.

Parquet is left as parquet.  Materialising 455,000 patches as loose files would
cost another ten gigabytes and a great deal of filesystem churn for nothing.
